# Keip Canvas UI Overview

The UI is built around a canvas that allows you to drag, drop, and
connect [EIP](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/) nodes to create integration flows.
In addition to being a design and documentation tool, the UI allows you to configure the behavior of the individual EIP
nodes, thus providing the ability to generate deployable integration flow artifacts (e.g. XML).

## Requirements

For local development, the following must be installed:

- Node.js v20
- npm v10 (other package managers should work as well)

[Volta](https://volta.sh/) is recommended for setting up your JS environment.

### Run the dev server

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OctoConsulting/keip-canvas.git && cd keip-canvas/ui
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run the development web server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Run tests

```shell
npm test
```

## Dependencies

The UI is mostly written in Typescript and relies heavily on the following libraries:

- [React](https://react.dev/): main UI library
- [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/): powers the interactive flow canvas
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand): state-management
- [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/): React component library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/): build tooling

## Structure

The source code is spread across multiple modules, some important ones are highlighted below:

### api

Defines the types and interfaces used across the UI components. Notably, the `api/generated` subdirectory contains
code generated from the [EIP Json schemas](../schemas/README.md). To use updated source schemas,
the [code-generation script](./genApiFromSchema.js) must be updated to point to the desired schema versions.
The API files can then be generated by running `npm run codegen`.
In this specific case, the generated files should be checked into version control to avoid the need to constantly
rebuild them.

### assets

Holds static assets such as the EIP icon SVGs.

### components

Contains all the UI's React components. Developers will likely spend the majority of their time working in here.

### json

Stores the [EIP Component Definition](../schemas/model/json/eipComponentDef.schema.json) JSON, which populates the
catalog of EIP nodes that a user is able to drag and drop onto the canvas.

### singletons

Initializes singleton instances that are required across the application, most notable is the `store` module.
The `store` module manages the React application's global state, through the use of a Zustand store.
The module does not provide direct access to the app store, rather several use-case/event specific custom hooks are
exported for use by components. This helps us keep stateful business logic encapsulated inside the store.

## Formatting and Linting

Formatting and linting is handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) respectively.

Formatting commands:

```shell
# check only
npm run check-format

# apply formatting
npm run format
```

Run linter:

```shell
npm run lint
```

Rules are configured in:

- Prettier: [.prettierrc.json](./.prettierrc.json)
- ESLint: [.eslintrc.cjs](./.eslintrc.cjs)

Consult your IDE's documentation on how to integrate these rules.
